# CI-CD-Docker-Automation
## Description: This repository is dedicated to the automation of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines using Docker and related tools. Find examples of configurations, scripts, and best practices to accelerate the development and deployment of applications with Docker.

## Project Idea

This repository is a dedicated resource for automating Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines using Docker and associated tools. The project's primary goal is to provide developers and DevOps teams with examples, configurations, and best practices for streamlining the development and deployment of applications within Docker containers.

## Technologies Used
The project leverages the following key technologies and tools:

- **Docker:** Docker is used for containerization, allowing applications to run consistently across different environments.

- **CI/CD Pipelines:** We provide examples of setting up CI/CD pipelines using popular tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions.

- **Container Orchestration:** We explore container orchestration solutions like Kubernetes for managing containerized applications at scale.

- **Monitoring and Logging:** Learn how to implement real-time monitoring and log collection with tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, Fluentd, and the ELK Stack.
